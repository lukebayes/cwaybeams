# TODOS

## Structure / Naming
* Extract tree.h and tree.c from dom implementation
* Make Attr.name into std int, but allow enums for concrete consumers
* ~~Rename Element to Node~~


## Utils
* Initial pass at selector queries


## Tools
* Find a good C styleguide, linter and formatter
* Get consistent with camelCase vs snake_case
