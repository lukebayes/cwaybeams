# CWAYBEAMS
_(Pronounced, "Sway-beems")_

This is not a thing. I'm just exploring some ideas in order to learn c.

If you're curious about what it might do or be, check out [examples/*](examples)

Also, check out the [blog](blog) for more info.

# Getting Started
I prefer to run cmake with an in-place build.

```bash
cmake . && \
make && \
./bin/cwaybeams-test && \
valgrind ./bin/cwaybeams-test
```
