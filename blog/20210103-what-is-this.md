# What is this?

This is first and foremost an exploration, but it might also be a manifesto (if I'm not careful about it).

I want to find out if there is a way to make native application development (across all of it's form factors), _"Fast, Stable and Delightful"â„¢_.

Something like the accessibility of Arduino, but for GUI applications? Perhaps with less of a performance penalty? Less flailing around?

What would the world be like if graphical applications were so easy and fast to produce, they were essentially disposable?

Give me a week or two, and I'll give you something that mostly does what you need it to do. Give me another couple days for every platform you want to deploy into? We can play and explore your business problem as long as you like, and you won't be blocked for 12 months while you pour millions of dollars into the toilet, only to find out there's no market for your big idea, or no way to migrate your business off of whatever terrible thing you're using today.

What if a person or two with very little training or experience could follow some relatively simple rules and generate something useful for a small or medium sized business? What if most of the UX solutions were already searchable, visible and even downloadable from a shared, curated resource?

What if we had a relatively small, terribly efficient language that also worked for describing UI?

I want to author an application and be able to observe it working reasonably well on _all_ the things. I expect to make explicit layout or content accommodations for various environmental constraints (e.g., Phone, Tablet, Desktop, TV, or maybe other axes such as inputs like, Touch, Keyboard, Speech, D-Pad, Sip-n-Puf, Screenreader, etc.), but I'm not interested in switching to a completely new language, development environment, debugger, libraries, test framework, or mental perspective, just because I want to render on _this_ device instead of _that_ device.

Today's state-of-the-art platform fragmentation doesn't just make me sad, it triggers something more like disgust. We didn't get here on good intentions and it's my intent to shatter these despicable boundaries and let people's creativity and business solutions be unleashed.

I have attempted to reach similar goals along these lines for many years, using just about every language I've come across, including ActionScript 2.0, ActionScript 3.0, Java, Haxe, JavaScript, NodeJs, Ruby, Python, Common Lisp, Scheme, and here... C.

Even though I can learn certain things quite quickly, I have to concede that for other things, I can be an incredibly slow. With that in mind, it has finally become painfully obvious to me, that if I want to write software that runs on _all of the things_, there is only one language that actually makes sense and that language is C. Not C++. Not Rust. Certainly not Go.

Only with C, can I make a tool that could conceivably work on every single thing from my [STM32L412X](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/microcontrollers/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus/stm32-ultra-low-power-mcus/stm32l4-series/stm32l4x2/stm32l412kb.html), to my [Ryzen 3900x](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-3900x) (running Linux), all the way to my Android Crap phone, or someone else's iDevice.

It does admittedly feel awkward to pick up this archaic and terrifying language so late in one's career, but here I am.

So I'm going on this journey, and looking forward to where it might take me...

I'll do my best to report along the way.
